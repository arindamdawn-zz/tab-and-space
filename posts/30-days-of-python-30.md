It has been a great experience learning the Python language for the past month. Although there are areas which I have been not been able to cover, I now am familiar with the basics and can start building projects and dive into more advanced concepts.

Over the last month, I have bookmarked some free and useful Python resources which I found very interesting. I would like to conclude this challenge by compiling all the resources in this post. It will come in handy for future reference and might help anyone looking to explore the world of Python.
